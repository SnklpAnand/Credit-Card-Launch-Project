# Credit-Card-Launch-Project

### Situation
- AtliQo Bank wanted to launch a new credit card but faced uncertainty about which customer segment to target and how to prove the card’s effectiveness before scaling.


### Task

- Phase 1: Analyze customer demographics, income, credit profiles, and spending behavior to identify the most promising target segment.
- Phase 2: Design and execute a controlled campaign to test if the new card actually drives higher spending.


### Action

- Cleaned and standardized messy data (ages, incomes, credit limits).
- Segmented customers by age, income, and spending habits.
- Identified 18–25 year-olds as an underutilized yet high-potential segment.
- Designed an A/B test campaign with 100 test customers and 40 control customers.
- Measured results using statistical testing (Z-test, p-value).


### Result

- Discovered that the 18–25 group is digital-first, lifestyle-driven, and underpenetrated in credit card usage (~25% of base).
- A/B test showed a ~7% increase in average spending for the test group compared to control (₹236 vs ₹221).
- Proved that targeting this segment with modest credit limits + e-commerce/fashion/beauty rewards is effective.
- Provided a data-backed recommendation to launch nationwide with a focus on this demographic.
